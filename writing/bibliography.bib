  abstract = {It is important to identify the ``correct'' number of topics in mechanisms like Latent Dirichlet Allocation(LDA) as they determine the quality of features that are presented as features for classifiers like SVM. In this work we propose a measure to identify the correct number of topics and offer empirical evidence in its favor in terms of classification accuracy and the number of topics that are naturally present in the corpus. We show the merit of the measure by applying it on real-world as well as synthetic data sets(both text and images). In proposing this measure, we view LDA as a matrix factorization mechanism, wherein a given corpus C is split into two matrix factors M 1 and M 2 as given by C d*w = M1 d*t x Q t*w . Where d is the number of documents present in the corpus and w is the size of the vocabulary. The quality of the split depends on ``t'', the right number of topics chosen. The measure is computed in terms of symmetric KL-Divergence of salient distributions that are derived from these matrix factors. We observe that the divergence values are higher for non-optimal number of topics \textendash{} this is shown by a 'dip' at the right value for 't'.},

These models can capture word correlations in a collection of textual documents with a low-dimensional set of multinomial distribution, called ``topics''. However, it is important but difficult to select the appropriate number of topics for a specific dataset. In this paper, we study the inherent connection between the best topic structure and the distances among topics in Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), and propose a method of adaptively selecting the best LDA model based on density. Experiments show that the proposed method can achieve performance matching the best of LDA without manually tuning the number of topics.},

We propose an unsupervised method namely Latent Concept Modeling (LCM) for mining and modeling latent search concepts in order to recreate the conceptual view of the original information need. We use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to exhibit highly-specific query-related topics from pseudo-relevant feedback documents. We define these topics as the latent concepts of the user query. We perform a thorough evaluation of our approach over two large ad-hoc TREC collections. Our findings reveal that the proposed method accurately models latent concepts, while being very effective in a query expansion retrieval setting.},

Recent work in sociology of culture, science, and economic sociology has shown how computational text analysis can be used in theory building and testing. This review starts with an introduction of the history of computer-assisted text analysis in sociology and then proceeds to discuss five families of computational methods used in contemporary research. Using exemplary studies, it shows how dictionary methods, semantic and network analysis tools, language models, unsupervised, and supervised machine learning can assist sociologists with different analytical tasks. After presenting recent methodological developments, this review summarizes several important implications of using large datasets and computational methods to infer complex meaning in texts. Finally, it calls researchers from different methodological traditions to adopt text mining tools while remaining mindful of lessons learned from working with conventional data and methods.},

The first, pattern detection step, involves inductive computational exploration of text, using techniques such as unsupervised machine learning and word scores to help researchers to see novel patterns in their data. The second, pattern refinement step, returns to an interpretive engagement with the data through qualitative deep reading or further exploration of the data. The third, pattern confirmation step, assesses the inductively identified patterns using further computational and natural language processing techniques. The result is an efficient, rigorous, and fully reproducible computational grounded theory. This framework can be applied to any qualitative text as data, including transcribed speeches, interviews, open-ended survey data, or ethnographic field notes, and can address many potential research questions.},

Res. 3, 993-1022], in which each document is generated by choosing a distribution over topics and then choosing each word in the document from a topic selected according to this distribution. We then present a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for inference in this model. We use this algorithm to analyze abstracts from PNAS by using Bayesian model selection to establish the number of topics. We show that the extracted topics capture meaningful structure in the data, consistent with the class designations provided by the authors of the articles, and outline further applications of this analysis, including identifying ``hot topics'' by examining temporal dynamics and tagging abstracts to illustrate semantic content.},
